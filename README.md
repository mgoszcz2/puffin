A simple program for replaying to tweets with a keyword with an image from an http server
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## To run

Provide your Twitter API keys, HTTP server and keyword to track in `config.json` (The Twitter app needs to have Read-Write permissions, obviously)

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

* You can use [Bunyan](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan) for pretty-printing the log output
* It can be configured through `config.json`
